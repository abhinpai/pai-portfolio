:::note Questions ü§î
1. Why hooks when there is a class
2. What problems hooks can solve
    * **Wrapper Hell (Reusable Logic)**, As an application grows maintainability will be very difficult we will end up by adding too many elements to the DOM tree which may lead to performance 
    * **Huge Components** trouble of having multiple life cycle methods and complex components are hard to understand
    ```jsx
        componentDidMount() {
            this.subscribeToStatus(id);
        }

        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
            prevProps != props ? true : false;
        }

        componentWillUnmount() {
            this.unsubscribeToStatus(id);
        }
    ```
    * **Confusing Classes**, Classes, confuse both people and machines

## Introduction

Hooks are a new player in React 16.8. They let you use stateful logic between the components. These are the special function which hooks into the context and can let you use it later

Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data)

:::note Questions ü§î
1. Why hooks when there is a class
2. What problems hooks can solve
    * **Wrapper Hell (Reusable Logic)**, As application grows maintainability will be very difficult we will be endup by adding to many element to the DOM tree which may led to performance 
    * **Huge Components** trouble of having multiple life cycle methods and complex components are hard to understand
    ```jsx
        componentDidMount() {
            this.subscribeToStatus(id);
        }

        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
            prevProps != props ? true : false;
        }

        componentWillUnmount() {
            this.unsubscribeToStatus(id);
        }
    ```
    * **Confusing Classes**, Classes confuse both people and machines

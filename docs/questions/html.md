- ✅ HTML vs HTML5

- ✅ HTML Semantic elements
  A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

  **Examples of non-semantic elements**: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

  **Examples of semantic elements**: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.

    |article|aside|details|
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |figcaption|figure|footer|
    |header|main|mark|
    |nav|section|summary|

- ✅ Semantic HTML

    An important principle in web design is the idea of using HTML elements to indicate what they actually are, rather than how they may appear in the browser by default. This is known as using semantic HTML.

    Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:
    - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
    - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
    - Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching though endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
    - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
    - Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

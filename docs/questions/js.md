### üî∏ Are semicolons required in JavaScript?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      Semicolons in JavaScript divide the community. Some prefer to use them
      always, no matter what. Others like to avoid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript does not strictly require semicolons. When there is a place
      where a semicolon was needed, it adds it behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process that does this is called {' '}

    <h2>It does the 4 things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It create a new instance for a function. The type of this instance will
        be an object

      <li>
        It sets this new object's <span className="chip">internal</span>, {' '}
        <span className="chip">inaccessible</span>, {' '}
        <span className="chip">[[prototype]]</span> {' '}

### üî∏ What is a closure, and how/why would you use this?

A closure is the combination of a function **bundled together (enclosed)** with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function‚Äôs scope from an inner function.

In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Whenever a function is declared in JavaScript a **closure** is created. inside the **IIFE**

**Closure Scope Chain: Every closure has `three` scopes**

1. Local Scope (Own scope)
2. Outer Functions Scope
3. Global Scope

```js
// global scope
var e = 10;
function sum(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      // outer functions scope
      return function (d) {
        // local scope
        return a + b + c + d + e;
      };
    };
  };
}

console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)); // log 20
```

**I came across great post on closure** please refer this to understand more [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work)

### üî∏ Can you give a useful example of closure?

- closure can be used for function currying
- Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event).
- You can emulate private methods with closures. Languages such as Java allow you to declare methods as private but JavaScript does not provide a native way of doing this, but it is possible to emulate private methods using closures, this resulting the modularization 

```js
var counter = (function () {
  var privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  }

  return {
    increment: function () {
      changeBy(1);
    },

    decrement: function () {
      changeBy(-1);
    },

    value: function () {
      return privateCounter;
    },
  };
})();

console.log(counter.value()); // 0.

counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // 2.

counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.value()); // 1.
```

### üî∏ What are the consideration that we need to avoid while working with closure

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if
        closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively
        affect script performance both in terms of processing speed and memory
        consumption
      </li>
      <li>Its not recommended to use closure inside a loop</li>
    </ul>

### üî∏ Can you give an example of a `curry function` and why this syntax offers an advantage?
<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p><span className="chip">Currying</span> is a function of many arguments that are rewritten such that it takes the first argument and returns a function which in turn uses the remaining arguments and returns the value.</p>
    <h4>Function currying do have multiple advantages like</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Currying is used in function composition to achieve function programming paradigm
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> What are the different ways to achieve function curry</h3>
    <p>Function currying can be achieve using <span className="chip">Closure</span> and <span className="chip">bind()</span></p>
    <h3>How currying is different from regular parameterized function?</h3>
    <p>Partial applications can take as many or as few arguments a time as desired. Curried functions on the other hand always return a unary function: a function which takes one argument.</p>
    <p>All curried functions return partial applications, but not all partial applications are the result of curried functions.</p>
    <p>The unary requirement for curried functions is an important feature.</p>

### üî∏ Explain how `Event Loop` works and explain the individual component that take a part in it 

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      You‚Äôve probably heard that JavaScript is a single-threaded language. You
      may have even heard the terms <span className="chip">Call Stack</span>,
      <span className="chip"> Event Table</span> and <span className="chip">Event Queue</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of event loop is very simple. There‚Äôs an endless loop, when
      JavaScript engine waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps waiting
      for more tasks.
    </p>
    <p><b>Lets see in more details one by one</b></p>
    <h3>The Call Stack</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript has a single call stack in which it keeps track of what script
      is to be executed and if the scripts belong to the event queue it will
      dispatch to the respective queue and when an event present in the call
      stack is completed it will popup eventually making room for next task. The
      call stack is made up of <span className="chip">stack frames‚Äîone</span> for each method
      call
    </p>
    <p>
      When you‚Äôre about to execute a function it is added on the call stack.
      Then if that function calls another function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe other function will be
      on top of the first one in the call stack. When you get an error in the
      console you get a long message that shows you the path of execution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis
      is what the stack looked in that exact moment. But what if we make a
      request or put a timeout on something? In theory that should freeze the
      entire browser until it is executed so the call stack can continue? In
      practice however, you know that this doesn‚Äôt happen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause of the {' '}
      <span className="chip">Event Table</span> and <span className="chip">Event Queue</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>The Execution Context Stack</h3>
    <p>
      –°all Stack and Execution Stack are different names for the same thing. It
      is a LIFO stack that is used to store execution contexts created during
      code execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Wikipedia says: </b>
      <i
        >"This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack,
        control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack" </i
      ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack"> Link </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>One more quote: </b>
      <i>
        "In reality, the JavaScript engine creates what‚Äôs called an {' '}
        <span className="chip">Execution Stack</span> (also known as the ‚ÄúCall Stack‚Äù)."</i
      ><a
        href="https://tylermcginnis.com/ultimate-guide-to-execution-contexts-hoisting-scopes-and-closures-in-javascript/"
      >
        Link
      </a>
    </p>
    <h4>What's stored in a stack frame?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Local variables</li>
      <li>Arguments passed into the method</li>
      <li>Information about the caller's stack frame</li>
      <li>
        The return address‚Äîwhat the program should do after the function returns
        (i.e.: where it should <b>"return to"</b> ). This is - usually somewhere
        in the middle of the caller's code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Event Table</h3>
    <p>
      Every time you call a setTimeout function or you do some async
      operation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is added to the <b>Event Table</b>. This is a data
      structure which knows that a certain function should be triggered after a
      certain event. Once that event occurs
      <b> (timeout, click, mouse move)</b> it sends a notice. Bear in mind that
      the Event Table does not execute functions and does not add them to the
      call stack on it‚Äôs own. It‚Äôs sole purpose is to keep track of events and
      send them to the Event Queue.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Event Queue
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Event Queue is a data structure similar to the stack‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääagain you add
      items to the back but can only remove them from the front. It kind of
      stores the correct order in which the functions should be executed. It
      receives the function calls from the Event Table, but it needs to somehow
      send them to the Call Stack? This is where the Event Loop comes in
    </p>
    <p>
      Event Queue is again divided into two that is {' '}
      <span className="chip">Micro Tasks Queue</span> and {' '}
      <span className="chip">Macro Task Queue (Task Queue)</span>
    </p>
    <h3>The Event Loop</h3>
    <p>
      We‚Äôve finally reached the infamous Event Loop. This is a constantly
      running process that checks if the call stack is empty. Imagine it like a
      clock and every time it ticks it looks at the Call Stack and if it is
      empty it looks into the Event Queue. If there is something in the event
      queue that is waiting it is moved to the call stack. If not, then nothing
      happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are a couple of interesting cases. In what order do you think the
      following code will run?
    </p>
    <div>
      <p><b>setTimeout(() => console.log('first'), 0)</b> <br/>
       <b>console.log('second')</b></p>
    </div>
    <p>Some people think that because set timeout is called with <b>0 (zero)</b> it should run immediately. In fact in this specific example you will see <b>‚Äúsecond‚Äù</b> printed out before <b>‚Äúfirst‚Äù</b>. JavaScript sees the setTimeout and says ‚ÄúWell, I should add this to my Event Table and continue executing‚Äù. It will then go through the Event Table, Event Queue and wait for the Event Loop to tick in order to run.</p>

### üî∏ What is Computed properties what us the typical use cases of this
<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      <b>Computed Property Names</b> feature allows you to have an expression (a
      piece of code that results in a single value like a variable or function
      invocation) be computed as a property name on an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, say you wanted to create a function that took in two
      arguments (<span className="chip">key</span>,
      <span className="chip">value</span> ) and returned an object using those
      arguments. Before Computed Property Names, because the property name on
      the object was a variable (<span className="chip">key</span> ), you‚Äôd have
      to create the object first, then use bracket notation to assign that
      property to the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, now with Computed Property Names, you can use object literal
      notation to assign the expression as a property on the object without
      having to create it first
    </p>
    <p>Where <span className="chip">key</span> can be any expression as long as it‚Äôs wrapped in brackets, <span className="chip">[]</span>.</p>
    <h3>What is the advantage of computed property names</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Computed property names are useful when we want to set a key for an object dynamically</li>
    </ul>

### üî∏ What is generators and how is it different from function

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      Generators are defined almost like normal functions, but instead of function,
      you use <span className="chip">function*</span>. Also in the body, a new keyword, <span className="chip">yield</span> can be used to
      return a stream of values from the generator.
    </p>
    <p> Unlike regular function generator is a special function which have a power to return multiple values from a single function and which can be control as per demand </p>
    <p>
      I have already documented lot of things about generator in  {' '}
      <a href="../javascript/modules/module10_generator">Module 10 Generator</a> please have a look once 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some good articles floating around  {' '}
      <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-hidden-power-of-es6-generators-observable-async-flow-control-cfa4c7f31435">Link-1</a> {' '}

    </p>
  </div>
</Collapsible>

### üî∏ What are the real use-case of the generators

1. Generators can be implement in replacement for an iterators

  Let me show you with a simple example. 

  Here i am just trying to generate natural no from 1, 10 using an `Symbol.Iterator`

  ```js
  let range = {
    from: 1,
    to: 10,

    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      return {
        current: this.from,
        last: this.to,
        next() {
          if (this.current < this.last) {
            return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
          } else {
            return { done: true };
          }
        },
      };
    },
  };

  console.log([...range]); // [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  ```

  Now the above can be simplified using generator

  ```js
  let range = {
    from: 1,
    to: 10,
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
      for (let i = this.from; i < this.to; i++) {
        yield i;
      }
    },
  };

  console.log([...range]);
  ```

2. Better Async functionality

  Code using promises and callbacks such as

  ```js
  function fetchJson(url) {
    return fetch(url)
      .then((request) => request.text())
      .then((text) => {
        return JSON.parse(text);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(`ERROR: ${error.stack}`);
      });
  }
  ```

  can be written as (with the help of libraries such as `co.js`) which uses the generator

  ```js
    const fetchJson = co.wrap(function* (url) {

### üî∏ Explain Function Decomposition

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      Functional Decomposition is the process of taking a complex process and
      breaking it down into its smaller, simpler parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, think about using an ATM. You could decompose the process
      into:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Walk up to the ATM
      </li>
      <li>Insert your bank card</li>
      <li>Enter your pin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>well...you get the point.</p>
    <p>
      You can think of programming the same way. Think of the software running
      that ATM:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code for reading the card</li>
      <li>PIN verification</li>
      <li>Transfer Processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of which can be broken down further. Once you've reached the most
      decomposed pieces of a subsystem, you can think about how to start coding
      those pieces. You then compose those small parts into the greater whole.

    <h3>Simple Explanations without code</h3>
    <p>
      A "parameter" is a very general, broad thing, but an "argument: is a very
      specific, concrete thing. This is best illustrated via everyday examples:
    </p>
    <h4>
      Example 1: Vending Machines - Money is the parameter, $2.00 is the
      argument
    </h4>
    <p>
      Most machines take an input and return an output. For example a vending
      machine takes as an input: money, and returns: fizzy drinks as the output.
      In that particular case, it accepts as a parameter: money.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is the argument? Well if I put $2.00 into the machine, then the
      argument is: $2.00 - it is the very specific input used.
    </p>
    <h4>Example 2: Cars - Petrol is the parameter</h4>
    <p>
      Let's consider a car: they accept petrol (unleaded gasoline) as an input.
      It can be said that these machines accept parameters of type: petrol. The
      argument would be the exact and concrete input I put into my car. e.g. In
      my case, the argument would be: 40 litres of unleaded petrol/gasoline.
    </p>
    <h4>Example 3 - Elaboration on Arguments</h4>
    <p>
      An argument is a particular and specific example of an input. Suppose my
      machine takes a person as an input and turns them into someone who isn't a
      liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is an argument? The argument will be the particular person who
      is actually put into the machine. e.g. if Colin Powell is put into the
      machine then the argument would be Colin Powell.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the parameter would be a person as an abstract concept, but the
      argument would always be a particular person with a particular name who is
      put into the machine. The argument is specific and concrete.

### üî∏ Does JavaScript pass by value or by reference?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>The primitive types (number, string, etc.) are passed by value, but objects are unknown, because they can be both passed-by-value (in case we consider that a variable holding an object is in fact a reference to the object) and passed-by-reference (when we consider that the variable to the object holds the object itself).</p>

### üî∏ What is `IIFE` and what are the use case of this?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>An Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE for friends) is a way to execute functions immediately, as soon as they are created.</p>
    <p>IIFEs are very useful because they don‚Äôt pollute the global object, and they are a simple way to isolate variables declarations.</p>
    <p>
      There is great article on IIFE {' '}

### üî∏ What is the reason for wrapping the entire contents of a JavaScript source file in a function that is immediately invoked?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      In its simplest form, this technique aims to wrap code inside a
      <b>function scope.</b>
    </p>
    <p>It helps decreases chances of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>clashing with other applications/libraries</li>
      <li>polluting superior (global most likely) scope</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It does not detect when the document is ready - it is not some kind of
      <b>document.onload</b> nor <b>window.onload</b>

### üî∏ Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      Arrow functions were created to simplify function scope and solving the
      this keyword by making it more simpler. They utilize the => syntax, which
      looks like an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Note: It does not replace the existing functions. If you replace every
        function syntax with arrow functions, its not going to work in all
        cases.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span className="chip">Arrow functions</span> are more like function
      statements, except that they <span className="chip">bind</span> the
      <span className="chip">this</span> to parent scope. If the arrow function
      is in op scope <span className="chip">this</span>, argument will refer to
      <span className="chip">window/global scope</span>, while an arrow function
      inside a regular function will have its this argument the same as its
      outer function.
    </p>
    <h3>When not to Arrow functions</h3>
    <h5>1. Inside object function</h5>
    <p>
      If we use arrow function inside an object then on use of <b>this</b> it
      may result to <b>undefined</b>
    </p>
    <h5>2. Object prototype</h5>
    <p>
      The same rule applies when defining methods on a prototype object. Instead
      of using an arrow function for defining method, which brings an incorrect
      context window
    </p>
    <h5>3. Invoking constructors</h5>
    <p>
      this in a construction invocation is the newly created object. When
      executing new Fn(), the context of the constructor Fn is a new object:
      this instanceof Fn === true.
    </p>
    <p>
      this is setup from the enclosing context, i.e the outer scope which makes
      it not assigned to newly created object.

### üî∏ Write a polyfill for `bind()`

A `bind()` using ES6 looks something like this

```js
let userInfo = {
  name: 'Abhin',
  nationality: 'India üáÆüá≥',
};

function displayDetails() {
  console.log(`${arguments[0]} ${this.name} from ${this.nationality}`);
}

let display = displayDetails.bind(userInfo, "Hello");
display(); // Hello Abhin from India üáÆüá≥
```

Now the **Polyfill** for the **bind** will look something like this 

```js {10-15}
let userInfo = {
  name: 'Abhin',
  nationality: 'India üáÆüá≥',
};

function displayDetails() {
  console.log(`${arguments[0]} ${this.name} from ${this.nationality}`);
}

Function.prototype.myBind = function (context, ...arg) {
    let fn = this;
    return function() {
        fn.apply(context, [...arg, ])
    }
}

let display = displayDetails.myBind(userInfo, "Hello");
display(); // Hello Abhin from India üáÆüá≥
```

Here the highlighted code is a `polyfill for bind` which does same things as native `bind`

### üî∏ What is polyfill why is that required

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      A polyfill is a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows
      functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older
      browsers, e.g., to support canvas (an HTML5 feature) in older browsers.
    </p>

### üî∏ What is Transpiling in JS

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      <b>Transpilers</b> are also known as source-to-source compilers. So in
      essence they are a subset of compilers which take in a source code file
      and convert it to another source code file in some other language or a
      different version of the same language. The ouput is generally
      understandable by a human. This output still has to go through a compiler
      or interpreter to be able to run on the machine.
    </p>
    <h4>Some examples of transpilers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Emscripten</b>: Transpiles C/C++ to JavaScript</li>
      <li>
        <b>Babel</b>: Transpiles ES6+ code to ES5 (ES6 and ES5 are different versions
        or generations of the JavaScript language)
      </li>
    </ul>

### üî∏ Explain Debounce and its applications

The `debounce` function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.

```js
function debounce(func, wait, immediate) {
  var timeout; // To keep track of when the event occurred

  return function executedFunction() {
    var context = this; // window / global context
    var args = arguments; // additional arguments it will in array
	    
    var later = function() {
      timeout = null;
      if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args); // looks for condition incase of immediate invocation
    };

    var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
	
    clearTimeout(timeout); // clear the previous timeout if any 

    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
	
    if (callNow) func.apply(context, args); // Incase of immediate function invocation
  };
};

var returnedFunction = debounce(function() {
    // The function's code
}, 250);

window.addEventListener('resize', returnedFunction);
```


simplified version of `debounce`

```js
function debounce(func, wait) {
  var timeout;

  return function() {
    var context = this; // window / global context
    var args = arguments; // additional arguments it will in array
	
    clearTimeout(timeout); // clear the previous timeout if any 

    timeout = setTimeout(later.apply(context, args), wait);
  };
};

var returnedFunction = debounce(function() {
    // The function's code
}, 250);

window.addEventListener('resize', returnedFunction);
```

#### Applications of Debouncing
- Debouncing can be use to limit the no of API calls in a website
- It also used to keep the track of user scroll event (Infinity Scroll)
- Its helpful for to keep track of the window resize 

### üî∏ Explain Throttling and its applications

Throttling enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over time. For example, ‚Äúexecute this function at most once every 100 milliseconds.‚Äù

```js
function debounce(func, wait) {
  var timeout;
  var flag = true;

  return function() {
    var context = this; // window / global context
    var args = arguments; // additional arguments it will in array
    if(flag) {
      later.apply(context, args);
      flag = false;  
    }

    clearTimeout(timeout); // clear the previous timeout if any 
    timeout = setTimeout(() => flag= true, wait);
  };
};

var returnedFunction = debounce(function() {
    // The function's code
}, 250);

window.addEventListener('resize', returnedFunction);
```

#### Applications of Throttling

- Throttling can be used the action based polling system
- It can also fit in when there is use cases to hit a button multiple time

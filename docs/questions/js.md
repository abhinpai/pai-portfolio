### üî∏ Are semicolons required in JavaScript?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p>
      Semicolons in JavaScript divide the community. Some prefer to use them
      always, no matter what. Others like to avoid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript does not strictly require semicolons. When there is a place
      where a semicolon was needed, it adds it behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process that does this is called {' '}

### üî∏ What happens when you call a constructor function with the `new` keyword

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <h2>It does the 4 things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It create a new instance for a function. The type of this instance will
        be an object
      </li>
      <li>
        It sets this new object's <span className="chip">internal</span>, {' '}
        <span className="chip">inaccessible</span>, {' '}
        <span className="chip">[[prototype]]</span> {' '}
        (i.e. __proto__)
      </li>
      <li>
        It makes the <span className="chip">this</span> variable point to the
        newly created object.
      </li>
      <li>Returns the newly created object</li>
    </ul>

### üî∏ `null` vs `undefined`

      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>
          null is simply means zero, empty or nothing 
        </td>
        <td>
          Undefined means not assigned any value
        </td>
      </tr>

### üî∏ What is a closure, and how/why would you use this?

A closure is the combination of a function **bundled together (enclosed)** with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function‚Äôs scope from an inner function.

In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Whenever a function is declared in JavaScript a **closure** is created. inside the **IIFE**

**Closure Scope Chain: Every closure has `three` scopes**

1. Local Scope (Own scope)
2. Outer Functions Scope
3. Global Scope

```js
// global scope
var e = 10;
function sum(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      // outer functions scope
      return function (d) {
        // local scope
        return a + b + c + d + e;
      };
    };
  };
}

console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)); // log 20
```

**I came across great post on closure** please refer this to understand more [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work)

### üî∏ Can you give a useful example of closure?

- closure can be used for function currying
- Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event).
- You can emulate private methods with closures. Languages such as Java allow you to declare methods as private but JavaScript does not provide a native way of doing this, but it is possible to emulate private methods using closures, this resulting the modularization 

```js
var counter = (function () {
  var privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  }

  return {
    increment: function () {
      changeBy(1);
    },

    decrement: function () {
      changeBy(-1);
    },

    value: function () {
      return privateCounter;
    },
  };
})();

console.log(counter.value()); // 0.

counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // 2.

counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.value()); // 1.
```

### üî∏ What are the consideration that we need to avoid while working with closure

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if
        closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively
        affect script performance both in terms of processing speed and memory
        consumption
      </li>
      <li>Its not recommended to use closure inside a loop</li>
    </ul>

### üî∏ What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?

<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <h4>Anonymous function is helpful for following cases</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When we required to pass a function as a parameter to the high order function for <b>ex: setTimeout, Array.prototype.map, promise, etc</b> </li>
      <li>Anonymous function is useful when we deal with the closure</li>
      <li>Anonymous function can also used for <b>callback</b></li>

        <th>
          <h3 className="no-margin">Native Object</h3>
        </th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Host Objects are created by the environment and are environment-specific. The best-known environment would be a web-browser or could be any other platform.</td>
        <td>A Native Object is created by the developer using predefined classes of JavaScript. These objects will have fully defined specification rather than by the host environment by</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Example</b> Window, Document, History, XMLHttpRequest (part of Web API), http, https, url, etc</td>
        <td><b>Example</b> Object (constructor), function, Date, Math, parseInt, eval, string methods, array methods, etc</td>

### üî∏ Can you give an example of a `curry function` and why this syntax offers an advantage?
<Collapsible>
  <div>
    <p><span className="chip">Currying</span> is a function of many arguments that are rewritten such that it takes the first argument and returns a function which in turn uses the remaining arguments and returns the value.</p>
    <h4>Function currying do have multiple advantages like</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Currying is used in function composition to achieve function programming paradigm
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> What are the different ways to achieve function curry</h3>
    <p>Function currying can be achieve using <span className="chip">Closure</span> and <span className="chip">bind()</span></p>
    <h3>How currying is different from regular parameterized function?</h3>
    <p>Partial applications can take as many or as few arguments a time as desired. Curried functions on the other hand always return a unary function: a function which takes one argument.</p>
    <p>All curried functions return partial applications, but not all partial applications are the result of curried functions.</p>
    <p>The unary requirement for curried functions is an important feature.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> closure can be used for function currying</li>
        <li> Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event).</li>
        <li> You can emulate private methods with closures. Languages such as Java allow you to declare methods as private but JavaScript does not provide a native way of doing this, but it is possible to emulate private methods using closures, this resulting the modularization</li>
